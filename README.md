Python script to add v_pred and ztsnr keys to Stable Diffusion models.

For conveniences sake, vpred.safetensors has the v_pred and ztsnr keys extracted from [NoobAI v-pred by Laxhar Lab](https://huggingface.co/collections/Laxhar/noobai-sdxl-vpred-67344921f014ee4955cc0d1c).

vpred.safetensors can be used as the file you specify to extract the v_pred and ztsnr keys from.
